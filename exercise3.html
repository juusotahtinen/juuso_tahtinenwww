            The first BMW M3 was based on the E30 3 Series and was produced from March 1986 to June 1991.
            The majority of E30 M3s were produced in the coupe body style, but limited volumes of convertibles were also produced.
            The E30 M3 differed from the regular E30 models in several areas. The same basic body shell was used, but 12 of the body panels were 
            unique to the M3, for the purposes of improving aerodynamics. 
            Box-flared wheelarches were used to accommodate a wider track width and larger wheels/tyres. 
            The only exterior body panels the regular 3 Series and the M3 shared were the bonnet, roof panel, sunroof and door inner panels.
            The brake calipers, rotors and master cylinder were unique to the M3 model.
